BS: Minecraft scripts
=====================

Good morning to all of you Minecraft server admins. Here at [RobbytuProjects][robbytu] we love open-source and giving back to the community. Because of that, we're open-sourcing almost our complete [Banjoserver][bsweb] platform.

In this repository you'll find the following Bash-based scripts we developed to run Banjoserver: one of the greatest Dutch Minecraft servers.

Dependencies
------------

These script depend on the following tools or packages:

* **bash** - Do you really need an explanation for this one?
* **[mcrcon][bukkit-mcrcon]** - An awesome tool for setting up rcon connections from the CLI. You might have to compile this yourself if you're using a 64-bit system.
* **[screen][gnu-screen]** - Most Linux distributions allow you to install this through their package managing system (i.e. *apt-get install screen*)

Forking and contributing
------------------------

Please fork us, improve our scripts and give back to the community by doing a pull request. We love improvement and we're sure you do, too.

If you find a bug, please report it to us by using the [contact form][contact] on our website, or by raising a new issue at Github.
